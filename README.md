# ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Classification with CNN

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic signs using image data.     
It's a computer vision application built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is a collection of traffic sign images, organized in folders by class.  
Each folder inside `myData/` corresponds to a specific traffic sign type (e.g., Stop, Yield, Speed Limit).

- Images are resized and normalized before training.
- Data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
